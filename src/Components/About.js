        <p>Navigation with a router in web development, particularly in single-page applications (SPAs) built with frameworks like React, allows users to move between different views or pages without
        reloading the entire web page.</p>

        <ol><strong>Single-Page Applications (SPAs)</strong>:
SPAs load a single HTML page and dynamically update the content as users interact with the app. This improves performance
 and creates a smoother user experience.</ol>
